Directory Explorer is a PowerShell-based GUI for Windows that lets users browse folders, view detailed file metadata, filter by size or text, hide system files, scan recursively, jump to quick paths, and export or delete items. Great for power users and sysadmins.

PS1 and EXE are the same app, just different execution. Use as see fit. 

> With PS1 file, drop the file in a location, open terminal/powershell, navigate to the directory, use **Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass** to remove script prompt, and then type in the .\DirectoryExplorer_v2.ps1 and enter. Execution policy will reset with close/reopen of terminal window.
